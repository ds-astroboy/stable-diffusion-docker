# Stable Diffusion in Docker

Runs the official [Stable Diffusion v1.4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)
release on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) in a GPU accelerated Docker
container.

```sh
./build.sh run 'An impressionist painting of a parakeet eating spaghetti in the desert'
```

## Before you start

The pipeline uses the full model and weights which requires 8GB+ of GPU RAM.
On smaller GPUs, you may need to modify some of the hardcoded parameters. It
should take a few seconds to create one image.

Since it uses the official model, you will need to create a [user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens)
in your [Huggingface account](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Save the
user access token in a file called `token.txt` and make sure it is available
when building the container.

## Quickstart

The model is managed using a single [`build.sh`](build.sh) script.

## Build

Make sure your [user access token](#before-you-start) is saved in a file called
`token.txt`. The token content should begin with `hf_...`

To build:

```sh
./build.sh build # or just ./build.sh
```

## Run

```sh
./build.sh run 'A high tech solarpunk utopia in the Amazon rainforest'
```

## Images

The model and other files are cached in a volume called `huggingface`.

The `build.sh` script creates and mounts an `output` folder as a volume in the
container. The images are saved as PNGs to that folder using the prompt text.
